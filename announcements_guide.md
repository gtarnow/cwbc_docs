Announcements Slides Style and Technical Guide
==============================================

Purpose
-------

The purpose of this document is to help church members create slides, photos, or other images that can be shown during Sunday announcements.

Context
-------

To display song lyrics, images, and sermon points during a Sunday service, the church uses software called ProPresenter. Sunday mornings for the ProPresenter volunteer are busy and require a lot of focus, so your announcement slide(s) must be 100% prepared and delivered before Sunday morning. Additionally, there are technical requirements to be able to display slides with ProPresenter that are also legible on the church's screens.

Style guidance
--------------

- How you generate your slide is not important (PowerPoint, Photoshop, Google Slides, Microsoft Paint, etc.), as long as it meets the technical requirements below.
- The screens at CWBC are not large, and small text cannot be easily read. For the congregation on a Sunday morning, the screens appear approximately as large as your phone screen held out at arm's length. If you slides are not legible at arm's length on a phone, they will not be legible on Sunday morning.
- Please note that it is not possible for the ProPresenter volunteer to edit your slide. ProPresenter can only edit content created in ProPresenter itself.

Technical requirements
----------------------

- Your slide must be an image in .png or .jpeg format.
    - Whichever program you use should have the ability to export as an image.
    - Note that if you simply want to show a photo, photos taken on iPhones will NOT work unless the file format is converted.
- Your slide must be in landscape orientation (plain photos taken in portrain are OK but are less easy to see).
    - It is highly encouraged to ensure your slide is in 16:9 aspect ratio, specifically 1920x1080.
- Your slide must be delivered by 7:00AM Sunday Morning.

Delivery instructions
---------------------

TBD.

Additional notes
----------------

The ProPresenter volunteer can create simple (text-only), short announcement slides. If you would like to use this option, submit your text exactly as you would like it displayed through the same delivery process as described above. Please note that only basic text formatting (bold, italics, and underline) can be accommidated.

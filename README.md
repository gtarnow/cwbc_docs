What is this website and why are we using it?
---------------------------------------------

GitHub is a website mostly used to store and control different versions of code to build software. It allows for code to be worked on by multiple people and integrated into the main program without interfering with one another and allowing for updates and history to be controlled. To be specific, Git is a software tool used for version control of code or other text, and GitHub is this website, which provides an interface and online hosting for git-managed projects.

Obviously this is not code, but GitHub can also be useful for storing documents in a way that allows for multiple people to review and edit changes, control which version is currently "official", all while being available online so the official and working versions are available to everybody. This eliminates the need to email around a single file for updates, and prevents the issue of the most up-do-date version being stuck on 1 person's computer.

Why not use another online document storage tool like Google Drive? There are two main reasons. First, making sure that everyone who needs access to files in Google Drive can be difficult to manage. People who need access to a document can't see it until access is explicitely granted. Second, edits and versioning of documents in Google Drive cannot be easily tracked, controlled, and reverted if need be, at least not with the free versions that most contributors have access to. GitHub solves the first issue by making the documents accessible to and editable by anybody, but edits are not incorporated unless approved. Not only are the documents available to anybody who has the link, but if changes or updates are needed, anyone can edit the files and suggest them to be incorporated. Github solves the second version-control issue by its very nature. Because these documents are rather technical and specific to the needs and equipment of the church, which may change rapidly, keeping these documents up-to-date and immediately accessible is important. GitHub makes both of those needs easy and controllable.
